 rca -- a rich/RPN scientific and programmer's calculator
  Any arguments on the command line are used as initial calculator input.
  Entering a number pushes it on the stack.
  Operators replace either one or two stack values with their result.
  Most whitespace is optional between numbers and operators.
  Input can include locale currency and grouping symbols: $12,345.67
  Always prefix hex (0x7f) or octal (0o177) input, even in hex or octal mode.
  Infix expressions are entered using (...), as in: (sin(30)^2 + cos(30)^2)
  Below, 'x' refers to top-of-stack, 'y' refers to the next value beneath.
  rca's normal exit value reflects the logical value of the top of stack.

 Numerical operators with two operands:
                 +, -     Add and subtract x and y
              *, or x     Multiply x and y
                 /, %     Divide and modulo of y by x
             ^, or **     Raise y to the x'th power
               &gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;     Right/left logical shift of y by x bits
             ror, rol     Rotate y right/left by x bits
            &amp;, |, xor     Bitwise AND, OR, and XOR of y and x
         setb, clearb     Set and clear bit x in y

 Numerical operators with one operand:
                    ~     Bitwise NOT of x (1's complement)
       chs, or negate     Change sign of x (2's complement)
                  nop     Does nothing
          recip, sqrt     Reciprocal and square root of x
        sin, cos, tan
     asin, acos, atan     Trig functions
                atan2     Arctan of y/x (2 operands)
                  exp     Raise e to the x'th power
      ln, log2, log10     Natural, base 2, and base 10 logarithms
       abs, frac, int     Absolute value, fractional and integer parts of x

 Logical operators (mostly two operands):
               &amp;&amp;, ||     Logical AND and OR
 ==, !=, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=     Arithmetic comparisons
                    !     Logical NOT of x

 Constants and storage:
             sto, rcl     Save, or push off-stack storage
                pi, e     Push constant pi or e
         lastx, or lx     Push previous value of x
              _&lt;name&gt;     Push variable
                    =     Assign variable.  RPN: &quot;3 = _v&quot;   infix: &quot;(_v = 3)&quot;
   variables, or vars     Show the current list of variables

 Unit conversions (one operand):
           i2mm, mm2i     inches / millimeters
           ft2m, m2ft     feet / meters
         mi2km, km2mi     miles / kilometers
             f2c, c2f     degrees F/C
           oz2g, g2oz     US ounces / grams
         oz2ml, ml2oz     US fluid ounces / milliliters
             q2l, l2q     US quarts / liters
             d2r, r2d     degrees / radians
           mpg2l100km     mpg to l/100km and vice versa

 Other:
                 (, )     Infix grouping
                    ;     Infix separator (in RPN, discards y)
   snapshot, sum, avg     Snapshot, sum or average stack, stop at &quot;mark&quot; if set
                 mark     Mark stack to limit later snap/sum/average
