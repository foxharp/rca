 rca -- a rich/RPN scientific and programmer's calculator
  Any arguments on the command line are used as initial calculator input.
  Entering a number pushes it on the stack.
  Operators replace either one or two stack values with their result.
  Most whitespace is optional between numbers and operators.
  Input can include locale currency and grouping symbols: $12,345.67
  Always prefix hex (0x7f) or octal (0o177) input, even in hex or octal mode.
  Infix expressions are entered using (...), as in: (sin(30)^2 + cos(30)^2)
  Below, 'x' refers to top-of-stack, 'y' refers to the next value beneath.
  rca's normal exit value reflects the logical value of the top of stack.

 Numerical operators with two operands:
                 +, -     Add and subtract x and y
              *, or x     Multiply x and y
                 /, %     Divide and modulo of y by x
             ^, or **     Raise y to the x'th power
               &gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;     Right/left logical shift of y by x bits
            &amp;, |, xor     Bitwise AND, OR, and XOR of y and x
         setb, clearb     Set and clear bit x in y
                    =     Assignment to variable

 Numerical operators with one operand:
                    ~     Bitwise NOT of x (1's complement)
       chs, or negate     Change sign of x (2's complement)
                  nop     Does nothing
          recip, sqrt     Reciprocal and square root of x
        sin, cos, tan     
     asin, acos, atan     Trig functions
                atan2     Arctan of y/x (2 operands)
                  exp     Raise e to the x'th power
      ln, log2, log10     Natural, base 2, and base 10 logarithms
       abs, frac, int     Absolute value, fractional and integer parts of x
                 (, )     Infix grouping
                    ;     Infix separator (in RPN, discards y)

 Logical operators (mostly two operands):
               &amp;&amp;, ||     Logical AND and OR
 ==, !=, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=     Arithmetic comparisons
                    !     Logical NOT of x

 Stack manipulation:
                clear     Clear stack
                  pop     Pop (and discard) x
         push, or dup     Push (a duplicate of) x
         lastx, or lx     Fetch previous value of x
        exch, or swap     Exchange x and y
                 mark     Mark stack for later summing
                  sum     Sum stack to &quot;mark&quot;, or entire stack if no mark
                  avg     Average stack to &quot;mark&quot;, or entire stack if no mark

 Constants and storage (no operands):
             sto, rcl     Save/fetch off-stack storage
                   pi     Push constant pi
                    e     Push constant e
              _&lt;name&gt;     Read or set a variable

 Unit conversions (one operand):

           ft2m, m2ft     feet / meters
         mi2km, km2mi     miles / kilometers
