# _rca_: a rich/RPN calculator

_rca_ is simple yet versatile.

 - it's a reverse polish notation calculator in the HP tradition

 - it can seamlessly evaluate infix-style expressions

 - it can run in floating point or integer modes

 - it has the trig and math functions expected in a scientific
    calculator

 - it has the word width selection and bitwise operators expected
    in a programmer's calculator

 - it's trivially incorporated into shell scripts

 - it's written in C, and maintained in a single source file

 - it's _not_ an arbitrary precision calculator like __dc__ or
   __bc__, it just does the best it can using the C math library
