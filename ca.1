.TH CA 1 ca
.SH NAME
ca \- an RPN (and more) programmer's calculator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR ca
.I [ initial ca command text ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
At it's heart, 
.B ca
is a reverse polish notation (RPN) calculator
modeled (very loosely) on the Hewlett-Packard operating model from
their long line of scientific calculators.  Input is free form, for
the most part.
.SH REVERSE POLISH NOTATION
Numbers entered by the
user are pushed onto a stack.  Operators pop those stack entries,
usually 1 or 2 at a time, and push the result of the operation back on
the stack.  Operators exist which cover the usual arithemetic
functions
.RB ( + ,
.BR - ,
etc),
as well as functions (e.g.,
.BR sin ,
.BR cos ,
.BR sqrt ),
bit-shifting 
.RB ( <<
and
.BR >>),
logical operations 
.RB ( && ,
.BR || ),
and comparators
.RB ( == ,
.BR !=,
.BR <=,
etc).  There are also a few unit conversions available
(e.g.,
.BR i2mm ,
.BR oz2g ,
.BR f2c ).
A complete list of operators can be obtained with the
.B ?
or
.B help
commands.  The top two elements on the stack, in HP tradition, are
sometimes referred to as 
.I x
and
.IR y .
.SH INFIX NOTATION
In addition, 
.B ca
supports infix style expressions (i.e., non-RPN expressions) which
must be enclosed in parentheses, and are constrained to a single input
line.  These expressions "escape" the RPN model, and are evaluated
with the usual rules of operator precedence.  The special symbol
.B X
can be used to reference the value of 
.I x
(the top of stack) when the infix expression was invoked.  (The top of
stack will
.I not
be popped or replaced.)  The five storage locations (accessed with
.B store
or 
.B s2
through
.B s5
can also be
referenced, using
.B r1
through
.BR r5 .
The result of the expression will be pushed on the RPN
stack.
.SH OPERATING Modes
.B ca
can be configured (via pseudo-operators, which pull their parameters from
the stack) to operate on floating point numbers, or integers, and to print
results in various ways.
.SS Floating point
The default mode for
.B ca
is floating point, which can be entered with the
.B F
command.  When in floating point mode (the default), the user can
control either the number of digits shown after the decimal point
(using
.BR decimals,
or
.BR K ),
or the total number of significant digits (using
.BR precision ,
or
.BR k ). 
So the value of pi multiplied by 1 million will display as 3.14159e+06
with 
.B 6 k
or as 3,141,592.6535898 with
.B 7
.BR K .
.P
All floating point values are "long double" in size.
.SS Integer
Integer mode, along with the default base for display purposes, is
selected with
.B D
(decimal)
(or
.B I
),
.B H
(hex),
.B O
(octal),
.RB or B
(binary) commands.
The default base is used by
the
.BR p ,
.BR P ,
and
.B autoprint
commands.
Regardless of the integer mode, individual values can be
viewed in any base using
.BR f ,
.BR d ,
.BR h ,
.BR o ,
or
.BR b .
(The full stack is printed when using
.BR F ,
.BR D ,
.BR H ,
.BR O ,
or
.BR B .
.P
The input base of a number is independent of the mode, and controlled
by entirely by how it is entered:  10, 0xa, 012, and 0b1010 are all
the same value.
.SS Integer width
By default the width of
.BR ca 's
integers is the maximum supported, but it can be configured to be as
narrow as 8 bits using the
.B width
(or
.BR w )
command.  The maximum supported width will be either the
width of the "long long" data type, or of the "long double"
mantissa, whichever is smaller.  This results in 64 bits on most CPU
architectures in 2025.  (One exception:  52 bits on Raspberry Pi
when running a 32 bit OS)
.P
To aid in reading long digit strings,
.B ca
by default will add commas to numbers it prints.
These can be disabled with the 
.B 0 commas
command.  In addition, both commas and the
"$" currency symbol will be silently stripped on input, which is convenient
when doing arithmetic on copy/pasted data.
.SH HELP
A complete list of operators/commands can be obtained entering 
.B ?
or
.BR help .
Many operators have two names:  
both 
.B width
and 
.B w
can be used to set word width, either 
.B ^
or 
.B **
can be used for exponentiation, 
.B *
and
.B x
will both multiply, etc.
.SH SPECIAL VALUES
The
.B pi
and
.B e
operators push the values of the obvious constants to the stack.
.P The
.B s1
through
.B s5
operators copy
.I x
to one of 5 off-stack storage locations (without
disturbing the stack).  The
.B r1
through
.B r5
operators recall those values, pushing them onto the stack, and can
also be used in infix expressions to reference those values.
.RB ( store
is synonymous with
.BR s1 ,
and
.B recall
with
.BR r1 .)
.P
A special operator 
.B sum
will pop and add up previous entries on the
stack, stopping when the stack is empty, or when a 
.B mark
is reached. 
The mark can be set before entering data for a subsequent 
.BR sum,
in order to limit its reach.  
.B sum
is the only operator to consume more than 2 stack elements.
.SH OPERATOR PRECEDENCE
When used as an RPN calculator, operator precedence isn't really
meaningful, since the stack paradigm makes all operators equal in that
regard.  But when evaluating an infix expression, the relative
precedence of operators is important.  The "precedence" command will
give a list, whose output is reproduced here.  Higher numbers denote
higher precedence.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.B ca
will normally exit with status 0 or 1, reflecting whether the value
currently at the top of stack is non-zero or not.  (I.e., a non-zero
value of
.I x
causes the program to return "success" in the shell sense.)
An exit status of 2 results if the stack is empty on exit. 
An exit status of 3 comes from internal (malloc) errors.  Usually
operational warnings and errors are assumed to be useful to the user,
and execution proceeds.  If the
.B errorexit
command has been given, then warnings and errors will result in an
exit status of 4.
