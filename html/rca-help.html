rca -- a rich/RPN scientific and programmer's calculator
 Any arguments on the command line are used as initial calculator input.
 Entering a number pushes it on the stack.
 Operators replace either one or two stack values with their result.
 Most whitespace is optional between numbers and operators, and can consist
  of spaces, tabs, or newlines.
 Numbers can include commas and $ signs (e.g., '$3,577,455').
 Numbers are represented internally as long double and signed long long.
 Max integer width is the shorter of long long or the long double mantissa.
 Always use 0xNNN/0NNN to enter hex/octal, even in hex or octal mode.
 An infix expression may be started with '('.  The evaluated result
  goes on the stack.  For example, '(sqrt(sin(30)^2 + cos(30)^2) + 2)' will
  push the value '3'.  All operators and functions, all unit conversions, and
  all commands that produce constants (e.g., 'pi', 'recall') can be referenced
  in infix expressions.  The infix expression must all be entered on one line.
 Below, 'x' refers to top-of-stack, 'y' refers to the next value beneath. 
 On exit, rca returns 0 if the top of stack is non-zero, else it returns 1,
 or 2 if stack is empty, and 3 in the case of program error.

Numerical operators with two operands:
                 +, -     Add and subtract x and y
                 *, x     Two ways to multiply x and y
                 /, %     Divide and modulo of y by x
                ^, **     Raise y to the x'th power
               &gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;     Right/left logical shift of y by x bits
            &amp;, |, xor     Bitwise AND, OR, and XOR of y and x
         setb, clearb     Set and clear bit x in y
                atan2     Arctan of y/x (i.e., 2 operands, in degrees)

Numerical operators with one operand:
                    ~     Bitwise NOT of x (1's complement)
          chs, negate     Change sign of x (2's complement)
          recip, sqrt     Reciprocal and square root of x
        sin, cos, tan     
     asin, acos, atan     Trig functions (in degrees)
      ln, log2, log10     Natural, base 2, and base 10 logarithms
       abs, frac, int     Absolute value, fractional and integer parts of x
                 (, )     Begin and end &quot;infix&quot; expression

Logical operators (two operands, except '!'):
               &amp;&amp;, ||     Logical AND and OR
 ==, !=, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=     Arithmetic comparisons
                    !     Logical NOT of x

Stack manipulation:
                clear     Clear stack
                  pop     Pop (and discard) x
          push, enter     Push (a duplicate of) x
            lastx, lx     Fetch previous value of x
           exch, swap     Exchange x and y
                 mark     Mark stack for later summing
                  sum     Sum stack to &quot;mark&quot;, or entire stack if no mark

Constants and storage (no operands):
        store, recall     Same as s1 and r1
   s1, s2, s3, s4, s5     Save x off-stack (to 5 locations)
   r1, r2, r3, r4, r5     Fetch x (from 5 locations)
                   pi     Push constant pi
