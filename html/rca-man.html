<span style="font-weight:bold;">NAME</span>
       rca - a rich/RPN (and more) programmer's calculator

<span style="font-weight:bold;">SYNOPSIS</span>
       <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">[</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">initial</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">rca</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">command</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">text</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">]</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">DESCRIPTION</span>
       At it's heart, <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span>is a command-line reverse polish notation (RPN) cal‐
       culator inspired (very loosely) by the long line of Hewlett-Packard
       scientific calculators.  Operators include scientific, logical, and
       bitwise operators.  In addition, <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span>can evaluate traditional infix ex‐
       pressions, greatly expanding its usefulness.  As a programmer's calcu‐
       lator, word width can be limited, for emulating the operation of any
       class of CPU.  Input is free form, for the most part, and <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span>is easily
       incorporated into shell scripts to provide floating point support.
       Whitespace is usually optional, though there may be cases where ambigu‐
       ity would get in the way.  Any text including and following a <span style="font-weight:bold;"># </span>charac‐
       ter will be ignored as a comment.

       The value at the top of the stack can be shown with the <span style="font-weight:bold;">p </span>command, and
       the entire stack with <span style="font-weight:bold;">P</span>.  Autoprinting (toggled on with <span style="font-weight:bold;">1 a </span>(or <span style="font-weight:bold;">1 auto‐</span>
       <span style="font-weight:bold;">print</span>) will print the top of the stack after every input line.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">REVERSE POLISH NOTATION</span>
       Numbers entered by the user are pushed onto a stack.  Operators pop
       those stack entries, usually 1 or 2 at a time, and push the result of
       the operation back on the stack.  Operators exist which cover the usual
       arithmetic operations (<span style="font-weight:bold;">+</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">-</span>, etc), functions (<span style="font-weight:bold;">sin</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">cos</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">sqrt</span>, etc),
       bit-shifting and manipulation (<span style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;&lt;</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">&gt;&gt;</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">&amp;</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">|</span>, etc), logical operations
       (<span style="font-weight:bold;">&amp;&amp;</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">||</span>), and comparators (<span style="font-weight:bold;">==</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">!=, &lt;=, </span>etc).  There are also unit con‐
       versions available (e.g., <span style="font-weight:bold;">i2mm</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">oz2g</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">f2c</span>, and more).  A complete list
       of operators can be obtained with the <span style="font-weight:bold;">?  </span>or <span style="font-weight:bold;">help </span>commands.  The top two
       elements on the stack, in HP tradition, are sometimes referred to as <span style="font-style:italic;">x</span>
       and <span style="font-style:italic;">y</span>.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">INFIX NOTATION</span>
       <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span>supports infix (i.e., traditional, normal) style expressions.  Such
       expressions must be fully enclosed in parentheses, and cannot cross to
       a new line.  (Infix expressions are translated to RPN by an implementa‐
       tion of Dijkstra's &quot;shunting yard&quot; algorithm, and then executed as
       usual.) A single line of input can be a mix of RPN notation (unparen‐
       thesized) and complete infix expressions (parenthesized).  The infix
       expressions &quot;escape&quot; the RPN model, and are evaluated with fairly typi‐
       cal rules of precedence (see <span style="font-weight:bold;">OPERATOR PRECEDENCE </span>below).  All input
       number formats are accepted in infix, just as in RPN.

       All <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span>stack operators can be used as infix functions, including the
       unary operators (i.e., <span style="font-weight:bold;">-</span>x <span style="font-weight:bold;">+</span>x <span style="font-weight:bold;">~</span>x <span style="font-weight:bold;">!</span>x), and all of the comparison, logi‐
       cal, and bitwise operators.  Infix expressions result in a value.  For
       example, the expression <span style="font-weight:bold;">(-3 + +5) </span>will result in &quot;2&quot; being pushed on
       the stack.  When single operand operators appear in infix expressions,
       the operand will always follow the operator.  With two operand opera‐
       tors, one operand will appear on either side of the operator.  So expo‐
       nentiation would be written as <span style="font-weight:bold;">( 3 ** 2 ) </span>(producing 9 as a result) and
       <span style="font-weight:bold;">(0 setb 3) </span>will give 8.  The expression <span style="font-weight:bold;">(sin 180 == cos 90) </span>has the
       value 1, i.e. &quot;true&quot;.

       The special symbol <span style="font-weight:bold;">X </span>can be used in an infix expression to reference
       the value of <span style="font-style:italic;">x</span> (the top of stack) when the expression was invoked.
       (The top of stack will <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> be popped or replaced.) The five off-stack
       storage locations settable (only in RPN mode) with <span style="font-weight:bold;">store </span>or <span style="font-weight:bold;">s1 </span>through
       <span style="font-weight:bold;">s5 </span>can also be accessed, by referencing <span style="font-weight:bold;">r1 </span>through <span style="font-weight:bold;">r5</span>.

       If an error occurs during evaluation of an infix expression, evaluation
       will cease, and the stack will be left as it was at the point of the
       error.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">OPERATING MODES</span>
       <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span>can be configured into two modes of operation:  floating point (the
       default) using the <span style="font-weight:bold;">F </span>command, and integer, using one of <span style="font-weight:bold;">D </span>(signed deci‐
       mal), <span style="font-weight:bold;">U </span>(unsigned decimal), <span style="font-weight:bold;">H </span>(hex), <span style="font-weight:bold;">O </span>(octal), or <span style="font-weight:bold;">B </span>(binary).

       The difference between the various integer modes lies purely in how
       values are displayed by default, but floating point and integer differ
       in a few additional ways.  Most math is done in long double, regardless
       of mode, but in integer mode all stack values are masked to the current
       word width, and sign extended, if necessary.

       The input base of a number is independent of the mode, and controlled
       entirely by how it is entered:  10, 0xa, 012, 0b1010 and 1e01 are all
       the same value.

   <span style="font-weight:bold;">Floating point</span>
       In floating point mode (i.e., <span style="font-weight:bold;">F </span>mode, all operations use the full size
       of long double.  Printing can be controlled by either the <span style="font-weight:bold;">precision </span>(<span style="font-weight:bold;">k</span>)
       command (which specifies a number of digits for the printf &quot;%g&quot; for‐
       mat), or by the <span style="font-weight:bold;">decimals </span>(<span style="font-weight:bold;">K</span>) command (which specifies the number of
       decimals for the printf &quot;%f&quot; format).  So the value of pi multiplied by
       1 million will display as 3.14159e+06 with <span style="font-weight:bold;">6 k </span>or as 3,141,592.6535898
       with <span style="font-weight:bold;">7 K</span>.

       Scientific notation (e.g., 1e09) will be used in <span style="font-weight:bold;">precision </span>mode when
       the exponent is less than -4, or greater than the chosen precision.
       (These cutoffs come from directly from printf.)  <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span>will try to pre‐
       vent you from printing with more than the available significant digits
       on the system:  the default <span style="font-weight:bold;">precision </span>value is set based on this limit
       (18 digits for most modern PC architectures), and can't be raised above
       it.  However, if viewing %f output (by choosing a <span style="font-weight:bold;">decimals </span>value), it's
       easy to start seeing &quot;unclean&quot; bits if the magnitude of the number
       grows beyond the number of significant digits.  The numbers are really
       big at that point:  over 1e19 on a modern system.  Use <span style="font-weight:bold;">precision</span>'s %g
       in those cases, which will hide insignificant digits.

       Because digital floating point is inexact, values are sometimes calcu‐
       lated which are <span style="font-style:italic;">almost</span> correct (like .99999999999... instead of 1), but
       not quite.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span>tries to help by &quot;snapping&quot; values that are very close
       to integers to those integers, and by rounding when the precision lim‐
       its of the floating point representation are reached.

   <span style="font-weight:bold;">Integer</span>
       Integer mode is selected with any of the following commands, which also
       choose the default display format: <span style="font-weight:bold;">D </span>(signed decimal), <span style="font-weight:bold;">U </span>(unsigned dec‐
       imal), <span style="font-weight:bold;">H </span>(hex), <span style="font-weight:bold;">O </span>(octal), or <span style="font-weight:bold;">B </span>(binary).  The default printing format
       is used by the <span style="font-weight:bold;">p</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">P</span>, and <span style="font-weight:bold;">autoprint </span>commands.  Regardless of the default
       format, individual values can be viewed at any time in any format by
       using <span style="font-weight:bold;">f</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">d</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">u</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">h</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">o</span>, or <span style="font-weight:bold;">b</span>.

       By default the width of <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca</span>'s integers is the maximum supported, but it
       can be configured to as few as 2 bits using the <span style="font-weight:bold;">width </span>(or <span style="font-weight:bold;">w</span>) command.
       The maximum supported width will be either the width of the <span style="font-style:italic;">long</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">long</span>
       data type, or of the <span style="font-style:italic;">long</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">double</span> mantissa, whichever is smaller.  This
       results in 64 bits on most PC architectures in 2025.  (An exception:
       52 bits on Raspberry Pi when running a 32 bit OS)

       Values will be masked to the chosen word width for both use and dis‐
       play, whether they are input by the user or result from an operation.
       Arithmetic on all values will be signed.  If floating operations are
       used on width-restricted integers, the width restriction will be ig‐
       nored for the operation, but masking will happen when storing the re‐
       sult.

   <span style="font-weight:bold;">Punctuation</span>
       To aid in reading long digit strings, <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span>can add commas to numbers it
       prints.  These can be toggled on or off with <span style="font-weight:bold;">0</span>/<span style="font-weight:bold;">1 c </span>(or <span style="font-weight:bold;">commas</span>).  Commas
       will never appear in the fractional part of a value.

       Both commas and the &quot;$&quot; currency symbol will be silently stripped on
       input, as a convenience for doing arithmetic on copy/pasted data.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">SPECIAL VALUES</span>
       The <span style="font-weight:bold;">pi </span>and <span style="font-weight:bold;">e </span>operators push the values of the obvious constants to the
       stack.

       The <span style="font-weight:bold;">s1 </span>through <span style="font-weight:bold;">s5 </span>operators copy <span style="font-style:italic;">x</span> to one of 5 off-stack storage loca‐
       tions (without disturbing the stack).  The <span style="font-weight:bold;">r1 </span>through <span style="font-weight:bold;">r5 </span>operators re‐
       call those values, pushing them onto the stack, and can also be used in
       infix expressions to reference those values.  (<span style="font-weight:bold;">store </span>is synonymous with
       <span style="font-weight:bold;">s1</span>, and <span style="font-weight:bold;">recall </span>with <span style="font-weight:bold;">r1</span>.)

<span style="font-weight:bold;">CONFIGURATION</span>
       A few commands/pseudo-operators control aspects of <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca</span>'s operation and
       appearance:

              The <span style="font-weight:bold;">F</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">D</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">U</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">H</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">O</span>, and <span style="font-weight:bold;">B </span>commands select float or integer opera‐
              tion, along with the default base for output.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span>starts in <span style="font-weight:bold;">F</span>
              mode.

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">precision </span>(or <span style="font-weight:bold;">k</span>) selects %g format for floating point output
              (e.g., &quot;1.2345e+09&quot;), along with the number of significant dig‐
              its.  This format is selected on startup, with 6 significant
              digits.

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">decimals </span>(or <span style="font-weight:bold;">K</span>) selects %f format for floating point output
              (e.g., &quot;1,234,500,000.00&quot;) along with the number of decimals af‐
              ter the point.

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">width </span>(or <span style="font-weight:bold;">w</span>) selects the word width used in integer mode.  The
              startup default is the system maximum (likely 64).

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">commas </span>(or <span style="font-weight:bold;">c</span>) toggles whether printed values will include comma
              characters for readability.  This is enabled by default.  The
              command's argument is 0 or non-zero.

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">degrees </span>toggles whether the trigonometric functions work with
              degrees or radians.  Degrees are selected when <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span>starts.  The
              argument is 0 or non-zero.

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">autoprint </span>(or <span style="font-weight:bold;">a</span>) toggles whether <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span>will print the value at the
              top of stack after every newline.  This printing will be sup‐
              pressed if the last action on the previous line explicitly set
              that value, since to print it again immediately would be redun‐
              dant.  Automatic printing is selected when <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span>starts.  The ar‐
              gument is 0 or non-zero.

       All of the listed commands will print a confirmation message, but to
       avoid confusion, that message will only print if the command is the
       last on its line of input.

       <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span>doesn't have a configuration file that's read on startup.  It does,
       however, take commands from the environment variable <span style="font-weight:bold;">RCA_INIT</span>, and from
       any arguments passed on the command line.  So initial conditions can be
       established by either of those methods.  All printed output from com‐
       mands run from $RCA_INIT is suppressed.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">HELP</span>
       A complete list of operators/commands can be obtained by entering <span style="font-weight:bold;">help</span>
       or <span style="font-weight:bold;">?</span>.  Many operators have two names, and this is indicated in the com‐
       mand listing.  If $PAGER is set in the environment, it will be invoked
       to display the help text.  Otherwise the text will be shown directly to
       the terminal.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">OPERATOR PRECEDENCE</span>
       When used as an RPN calculator, operator precedence isn't meaningful,
       since the stack paradigm makes all operators equal in that regard.  But
       when evaluating an infix expression, the relative precedence and asso‐
       ciativity of operators is important.  The <span style="font-weight:bold;">precedence </span>command will give
       a list, whose output is reproduced here.  Higher numbers denote higher
       precedence.  The 'R' flag denotes operators which are right associa‐
       tive.  All others group left to right.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">OPERATOR NOTES</span>
       Most operators behave as they are commonly understood to.  A few need
       more specific documentation.

              The precedence and association of exponentiation (<span style="font-weight:bold;">^ </span>or <span style="font-weight:bold;">**</span>) is
              worth calling out, since implementations vary.  In <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca</span>'s infix
              expressions, exponentiation is right associative, and has lower
              precedence than unary minus.  So each of these lines returns a
              result of 1 (true):

                     <span style="font-weight:bold;">((2 ^ 3 ^ 2) == (2 ^ (3 ^ 2))) </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">#</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">512</span>

                     <span style="font-weight:bold;">((-3 ^ 2) == ((-3) ^ 2))) </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">#</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">9</span>

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">modulo </span>is a floating point operation.  It uses the C fmodl() li‐
              brary.

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">frac </span>applied to negative values will give a negative result.

              In an infix expression, any operator that takes two arguments
              expects them to be to the left and right of the operator.  This
              is expected in the case of the symbolic operators (as in <span style="font-weight:bold;">1 + 2</span>
              ), but for the named operators it can be odd looking.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">(0xf0</span>
              <span style="font-weight:bold;">setb 3</span>), for example, sets bit 3 in 0xf0.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">atan2 </span>works simi‐
              larly: <span style="font-weight:bold;">(sin 30 atan2 cos 30) </span>could also be written as <span style="font-weight:bold;">((sin 30)</span>
              <span style="font-weight:bold;">atan2 (cos 30)) </span>and will return the result &quot;30&quot;.  (In RPN, this
              would be <span style="font-weight:bold;">30 sin 30 cos atan2</span>.)

              Trigonometric operations (<span style="font-weight:bold;">sin</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">cos</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">tan</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">asin</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">acos</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">atan</span>, and
              <span style="font-weight:bold;">atan2</span>) are disallowed in integer mode, since they'd make no
              sense.  By default the trig functions take and return angles in
              degrees.  The <span style="font-weight:bold;">0 degrees </span>toggle command will switch them to radi‐
              ans.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">1 degrees </span>will switch them back.

              Bitwise operations (<span style="font-weight:bold;">~ &lt;&lt;</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">&gt;&gt;</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">&amp;</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">|</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">xor</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">clearb</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">and setb</span>) con‐
              vert their operands to long long first, regardless of mode.
              These operations will (as might be expected) discard fractional
              parts, and may discard significant digits, including the sign of
              the value.

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">sum </span>will pop and add up previous entries on the stack, stopping
              when the stack is empty, or when a stack marker previously set
              with the <span style="font-weight:bold;">mark </span>command is reached.  The mark would be set before
              entering the data for a subsequent <span style="font-weight:bold;">sum, </span>in order to limit its
              reach.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">sum </span>is the only operator to consume more than 2 stack
              elements.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">DATA TYPES, OVERFLOW, ACCURACY</span>
       All stack values in <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span>are stored in <span style="font-style:italic;">long</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">double</span> format.  This is con‐
       venient for a calculator which will primarily deal with floating point,
       but can be a problem with <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca</span>'s mixed model.  Many operations (primar‐
       ily the bitwise operations, but also simply working in other bases and
       word widths) require conversion to integer.  The <span style="font-style:italic;">long</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">long</span> type is used
       in this case; results are converted back when finished.  If the conver‐
       sion from <span style="font-style:italic;">long</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">double</span> to <span style="font-style:italic;">long</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">long</span> can't be done without loss, a warn‐
       ing is issued.  This may happen while printing the value in an integer
       base, after switching to an integer mode, or while performing a bitwise
       operation.  Execution will proceed after the warning unless <span style="font-weight:bold;">errorexit</span>
       has been enabled.

       Floating point math by its nature is imprecise.  It's not uncommon for
       small rounding errors, and errors introduced by the necessary binary to
       decimal conversions, to change values in obvious ways.  Something that
       should be 0 may instead have a very tiny value, or two numbers which
       should be equal may differ by an insignificant amount.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span>attempts to
       help by adjusting values pushed on the stack.  First, values within
       about 2e-18 (system dependent) of an integer are forced to that.  inte‐
       ger.  Then, values are decimal-rounded to <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca</span>'s maximum precision
       (again, usually 18 digits).

<span style="font-weight:bold;">EXIT STATUS</span>
       <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span>will normally exit with status 0 or 1:  to satisfy normal shell se‐
       mantics, a non-zero value at the top of the stack causes an exit status
       of 0, and vice versa.  An exit status of 2 results if the stack is
       empty on normal exit.  An exit status of 3 comes from unrecoverable in‐
       ternal errors (e.g., failed memory allocation).  Operational warnings
       or errors regarding parsing, empty stacks, or data conversion are as‐
       sumed be useful to the user, and non-fatal.  If the <span style="font-weight:bold;">errorexit </span>command
       has been given, then those warnings and errors will result in an exit
       status of 4.  This can be helpful when <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span>is used non-interactively.
       (Once given, <span style="font-weight:bold;">errorexit </span>cannot be rescinded.)

<span style="font-weight:bold;">SHELL SUPPORT</span>
       <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span>can take initial input from the command line, and returns a helpful
       set of exit codes, so incorporating it into the shell is straightfor‐
       ward:

              # This shell snippet gives simple access to rca's floating point
              # capability from a POSIX shell.
              #
              # After including this code, use lines like this to calculate:
              #       foo=$(fe &quot;$bar * pi&quot;)
              # or like this for a conditional:
              #       if fc &quot;(10 * 3) &lt; $foo&quot;; then ...
              #
              # Set common initial conditions:
              # 3 decimals , no commas, fail on error.  Values previously set will override.
              export RCA_INIT=&quot;3K 0commas errorexit ${RCA_INIT:-}&quot;

              _rca_run()    # support routine
              {
                  output=$(rca &quot;( $* )&quot; q)
                  exitcode=$?

                  if [ $exitcode -le 1 ]; then
                      echo $output
                      return $exitcode
                  fi

                  echo rca failure: $output &gt;&amp;2
                  exit 1
              }

              fe()    # Evaluate a floating point expression.
              {
                  _rca_run &quot;$*&quot;
                  return 0
              }

              fc()     # Evaluate a floating point conditional expression.
              {
                  _rca_run &quot;$*&quot; &gt;/dev/null
              }

<span style="font-weight:bold;">AUTHOR</span>
       Paul Fox created <span style="font-weight:bold;">rca </span>(formerly called &quot;ca&quot;) very slowly over a span of
       decades, starting in 1993.
