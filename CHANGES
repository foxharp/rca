v17 changes
    new "engineering" display format, new "digits" command, and
    renaming of existing display formats result in UI breakage:
    "precision", "decimals", "k", and "K" commands are gone, replaced
    by new no-argument commands:  "automatic/auto", "fixed", and
    "engineering/eng".  a new "digits" command specifies the number of
    floating point display digits.

    new snapshot/restore commands, for saving/restoring the entire stack

    rca_float: fixed handling of RCA_INIT, and rca's stderr

    improved rca's handing of input parsing errors.

    added Makefile install/uninstall targets (default to /usr/local)

v16 changes   (2/5/2026)
    removed unsigned math, and unsigned display mode.  neither make
    sense in the context of a practical calculator.

    improved help, and the way version numbers are maintained.

v14 change   (2/2/2026)
    implement option of right alignment for output values

    refactored how command output is managed.  commands are now
    silent unless they were entered last on a line.

v13 changes   (1/30/2026)
    octal input/output now use the "0o" prefix instead of just "0"

    added "zerofill", for left-filling in hex, binary, octal modes

    added unit conversion for mpg to l/100km

    some churn for deploying on github

v12 changes   (1/28/2026
    lots of work on precedence and associativity

    introduced the ";" operator to allow multiple expressions in (...)

    added dynamic variables (e.g., "_myvar"), eliminated r1-r5, s1-s5

    more rigorous about catching infix syntax errors

    better tracing support

    added "exp" operator

    "lastx" now works in infix

v10 changes   (1/13/2026)
    added "avg" command (similar to "sum")

v9 changes   (1/9/2026)
    "groups" command renamed to "separators"

v8 changes   (1/1/2026)
    no more hidden commands
    readline command completion
    tests/verification of poles/nan/inf for tan, powl

v7 changes   (12/30/25)
    standardize error messages
    add raw floating hex support
    improve "mark" command
